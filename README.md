# Vascul Andrei - 917
## I've decided to use JS for this project due to my familiarity with it (I hope it is not a problem), and during the development process I've found some time to also give it a simple UI.

This code may look like spagetti, but in JS it is encouraged to write more readable code instead of focusing on memory efficiency, due to its garbage collector. Although I use lots of constant variables, I don't use them to save memory, but to make the code more readable and easier to maintain / refactor.
```javascript
const inputArray = input.split(' '); // immutability is encouraged in JS, even more so in external libraries like React.
```
I wrote this project originally in Typescript for its type safety, but I've decided to rewrite it in JS for you to be able to run it without compiling it.

# How to review the project?
Although the source code is avaliable in the 'src' directory for you to see, I highly recommend downloading the 
**[compressed.html](https://github.com/Vascool14/LogicaProiect/blob/main/for-teacher/compressed.html)**
file (6.45kb) and run in within your browser, as this is the easiest way for you to see the project in action, I didn't want you to have to install any dependencies and compile the code as I know that you have a lot of projects to review.
