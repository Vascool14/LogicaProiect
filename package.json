  "description": "arithmetic operations for positive integers: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by one digit, in a base p ∈ {2,3,...,9,10,16}  - conversions of natural numbers between two bases p,q ∈ {2,3,...,9,10,16} using the substitution method or successive divisions and rapid conversions between two bases p,q ∈ {2, 4, 8, 16}.  and must have a menu such that all operations and conversion methods to be verified separately.  The executable form, the code of the application and the documentation will be submitted in the corresponding assignment on Teams. The documentation will follow the same structure as the Programming Fundament’s documentations, and it must contain at least: the problem statement for the implemented application, the used algorithms in pseudo-code, implementation considerations and test data.",
